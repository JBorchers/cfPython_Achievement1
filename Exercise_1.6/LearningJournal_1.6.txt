Exercise 1.6: Connecting to Databases in Python


1.	What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

Databases are organized collections of data, that makes accessing and managing data more efficient. Using them in coding like Python enhances data integrity, consistency, security, and enables complex searching/querying


2.	List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:

VARCHAR(n) - String of variable length, with n representing the maximum number of characters
INT - Standard integers; stores whole numbers (without decimal points)
DATETIME - used to store date and time values. It holds both the date and time components, allowing you to store specific moments in time
	
	

3.	 In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

SQLite might be preferable over MySQL for small-scale projects, embedded systems, or applications where simplicity, low resource usage, and single-user access are key. MySQL is better suited for larger-scale applications with multiple users, higher concurrency, and advanced features.



4.	Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

Python is much easier to read and it is very forgiving, thus making it seem easier to write than JavaScript. Even though it's easier to understand than JavaScript, it still remains an incredibly powerful language. The neat part about JavaScript, however, is the ability to work on both front and backend environments, while Python is made more for backend.



5.	Now that youâ€™re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?


Python is relatively slower in execution speed compared to compiled languages and its Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which can hinder performance in multi-threaded applications. Additionally, its mobile and frontend development capabilities are somewhat limited compared to languages like Java or JavaScript.
